# COMICS_data
Code used to synthesise, clean and arrange COMICS cruise (DY086) data for publication in Nature Scientific Data

## COMICS data analysis for SUMMER WP4
The aim here was to output a dataset from the COMICS 1 cruise (DY086; November-December,2017) that is usable by SUMMER WP4 modellers. The cruise made three visits to ocean observatory station P3 in the South Atlantic. Extensive biogeochemical measurements included quantification of three carbon fluxes (gravitational, active and passive); very few instances of simultaneous flux measurements exist in scientific literature. The COMICS cruise data can help to meet an important objective of SUMMER project: to understand the importance of the ecosystem services provided by mesopelagic fishes.

The dataset contains 6 data files:
  1. CTD (physical, chemical and biogeochemical parameters)
  2. High resolution POC concentration, flux and change in POC concentration (glider-derived)
  3. Discrete ship-based POC concentration and flux measurements
  4. Zooplankton and micronekton biomass, respiration and ingestion
  5. Acoustic backscatter
  6. Meteorology

The data has been submitted to PANGAEA and will be publicly available. An accompanying paper has been submitted to Nature Scientific Data. Both data and paper submission contain a full list of authors that contributed to the data collection effort and/or subsequent scienitific investigation.
